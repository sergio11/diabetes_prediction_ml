# Predicting Diabetes Diagnosis Using Machine Learning 📊💉

Diabetes is a major global health concern affecting millions of people every year. Early diagnosis can greatly improve the quality of life for patients, and this project aims to develop a **machine learning model** that predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on medical data. 🧑‍⚕️💡

Using a dataset from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**, we focus on female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and older. The dataset includes medical attributes such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more, which will be analyzed to create an accurate predictive model. 📈🔍

Our goal is to create a **robust model** capable of diagnosing diabetes with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals and improving early detection for patients. 🏥🔬

## Tools and Techniques 🔧🧠

In this project, we will use the following machine learning techniques to build, optimize, and evaluate the model:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔎
- **Feature Engineering** ⚙️
- **Data Preprocessing** 🔄
- **Modeling with various algorithms** 🤖:
  - RandomForestClassifier 🌲
  - Logistic Regression 📊
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 🤝
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC) 🧱
  - Decision Tree Classifier 🌳
  - AdaBoost Classifier 🚀
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier 📈
  - XGBoost Classifier 🌟
  - LightGBM Classifier 💡

We will optimize the models through **hyperparameter tuning** 🔧 and evaluate their performance with metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**. 📊
